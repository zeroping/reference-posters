Reference Posters
=================

These are vector reference posters to print out and hang on your wall. For now, I'm starting with electronics posters, but I don't mind people adding thier own posters.


Structure
---------

For now, let's have a directory per poster, with all of the resources used to make that poster in that directory. Ex: if you made a spreadsheet in order to format a table in the poster, it's handy to keep that .ods in there as well.

Additionally, if you can, render the posters to PDF when you're done. We'll keep the PDF in that poster's directory as well.
